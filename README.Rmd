# kfoldr

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of `kfoldr` is to provide an implementation of k-fold cross-validation with an exhaustive search over specified parameter combinations. It includes a flexible framework for calculating binary metrics, generating interactive Bokeh plots, and assessing model performance through bootstrap resampling. This package is designed to streamline the evaluation of machine learning models, particularly in the context of binary classification tasks.

## Installation

Here is the installation for a development version of `kfoldr`:

``` r
devtools::install_github("danymukesha/kfoldr")
```
